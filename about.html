				<p>
				Hello, my name is Christian Johnson. I am currently attending The New York Code & Design Academy in the Philadelphia Office. My first class was on April 16, 2018 and will end on July 6, 2018. I am building this website to practice web page development using HTML5 and CSS3.
				</p>
				<p>
				I got my first taste of computers when I was 15 in my summer before 9th grade. I attended a vocational high school where I received computer software and hardware training. I was able to get my A certification and get an internship my Senior year of High School. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Company that hired me for my internship was called Hill International. I was at the company for 17 years (March ’01 – March ’18). I started from an IT Intern answering phones on Helpdesk and visiting customers in Site Support. To deploying and configuring servers, setting up the IT infrastructure for new offices and job sites and I got to travel.
